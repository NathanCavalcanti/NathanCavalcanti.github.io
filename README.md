# Nathan Cavalcanti — Security Analyst & Network Engineer

I’m a Blue Team–oriented cybersecurity professional with **14+ years in IT** (from helpdesk to network engineering) now focused on **SOC operations, detection engineering, and DFIR**. I build realistic labs, tune detections, and document clear, actionable findings.

## What I do
- **SOC & Monitoring**: triage, alert tuning, baselining, threat hunting.
- **Detection Engineering**: custom rules for Wazuh/Suricata/Zeek; Sigma mindset.
- **Network Security**: segmentation, IDS/IPS, packet analysis (Wireshark/Zeek).
- **DFIR Basics**: timelines, log correlation, quick scoping and containment.

## Highlights
- **OpenSEC Network Defense (SOC Blue Team Lab)** — end-to-end lab integrating Wazuh, Suricata, Zeek and Kibana with active response and ATT&CK-mapped detections.
- **Hands-on learning** with TryHackMe/TCM: replaying OWASP Top 10 scenarios, Nmap/DoS detections, incident-style write-ups.
- **Leadership roots**: led technical teams, built processes, documented runbooks/playbooks.

## Core Skills
`SOC Analysis` · `Detection Engineering` · `Log Analysis` · `Network Security` ·  
`Incident Response (L1)` · `Packet Analysis` · `Linux` · `CLI`

## Tools I use
**SIEM/EDR**: Wazuh, Elastic/Kibana, Splunk  
**NSM/IDS**: Suricata, Zeek  
**Forensics/IR**: Wireshark, Volatility (basics), Autopsy (basics)  
**Offensive for blue-on-blue**: Metasploit, Burp Suite (for lab simulations)  
**Networking**: Cisco (CCNA), MikroTik

## Certifications
- **CCNA — Cisco Certified Network Associate**
- **CBROPS 200-201 — Cisco Certified CyberOps Associate**
- **MikroTik certifications**
- *(In progress)* **Practical SOC Analyst Associate (PSAA) Certification**

## Selected Projects
- **OpenSEC Network Defense (SOC Lab)** — SIEM + IDS/IPS + attack simulations → <link to your repo or write-up>  
- **Enterprise Network Lab (CCNA)** — multi-site design, HSRP, OSPF, DHCP Snooping/DAI → <link>  
- **Azure AZ-104: Virtual Networking & VPN** — VNets, IPSec/IKEv2, routing → <link>

## Work I’m looking for
**SOC Analyst (L1)** · **Blue Team / Detection** · **DFIR (entry-level)**  
Open to roles where I can **operate, measure, and improve** detection & response.
